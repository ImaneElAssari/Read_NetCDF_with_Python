# Read_NetCDF_with_Python

NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a hierarchical data format with a .nc extension known as a “self-describing” data structure which means that metadata, or descriptions of the data, are included in the file itself and can be parsed programmatically meaning that they can be accessed using code or specific software programs same as Panoply or QGIS. 

This notebook shows some basic Python instructions that permits you to read and explore yout NetCDF file.

We are going to use the ANTARES dataset from SEANOE-EMSO- Ligure Ouest observatory data which can be accessed using the following link: https://www.seanoe.org/data/00360/47129/

Bien à vous ! :)
